Introduction to Docker Presentation presentated at [Docker-Atlanta Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Atlanta/).

The majority of the slides are stolen from [docker.io/learn_more](http://www.docker.io/learn_more/).

### Demo Information

A `Vagrantfile` has been provided to jump start you. Activate it the usual way with `vagrant up` and `vagrant ssh`.


Also inside there's a simple `Dockerfile` that builds a simple container holding Apache.

To use it, execute `docker build apache` once inside vagrant.
